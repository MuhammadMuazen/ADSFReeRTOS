1) Sensors (Input):
      
      1. Heat Sensor
      2. GPS that connects with the satellite
      
2) Aactuator (Output):

      1. Alert system
      2. Missile launch system

3) Inner Actions:
      
      1. Classification: Check if the object in the sky is an allay or an enemy
      2. Path Determenation: if the object is any enemy does it need to be intercepted or not
      3. Interception status: did we intercepted the object successfully?

4) The perfect cycle for interception: 

      1. The heat system catches the object in the sky || The GPS system catches an object in the sky
      2. Our system classify the object in the sky
      3. If the object is enenmy calculate the path of it and check if it is needed to be intercepted
      4. If the object need to be intercepted launch an object for interception
      5. Launch the alerts 
      6. Keep track of the interception status if it worked stop all the alerts and go back to the idle status

5) Idle state:

      1. The heat Sensors are working
      2. The GPS sensor is working
