1) The heat capture system:
    infrared (IR) sensors, which detect heat signatures from objects, such as aircraft or missiles. 
    These sensors are part of infrared search and track (IRST) systems or heat-seeking missile guidance systems.

    AN/AAQ-37 DAS: used in the defense system of the F35s fighter jet
                    response time: between 10 - 20 ms
    
    {{ Should not be more that 10 to 50 ms between the object detection and classification }}
    {{ The whole sensing process should not take more than 100 - 200 ms}}

2) The satalite detection:
    performs missile detection and early warning using satellites
    
    Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS): 
        SBIRS Cycle:
            Detection: between 3 - 5 seconds
            Data processing: between 2 - 5 seconds
            Communication: 5 - 10 seconds
            Decesion and alert: 5 - 10
        
    {{ In the end the full cycle can be 20 seconds for average }}

3) Alerting sound:
   Start the alert sound system
   
   Israel's Red Alert System (Tzeva Adom):
      response time: between 1 - 2 seconds

4) The classification takes about 5 - 10 seconds

5) The shooting time takes about 5 seconds for the close range objects

6) Communication with the missile setup: 1 - 5 seconds

7) 

{{ The whole process should not take more than 10 - 30 seconds }}
