Finite State Machine (FSM)

States & Transitions:
(-) Action
(--) Transition Trigger
1- Idle:
	- Sensors are active, waiting for detection.
	-- Transition to (Detection) state upon object detected.
2- Detection:
	- Heat Sensor and GPS detects an object.
	-- Transition to (Classification) state after sensor data is processed.
3- Classification:
	- Classify the object as ally or enemy.
	-- Transition to: 
		- (Idle) state if ally.
		- (Path Determination) state if enemy.
4- Path Determination:
	- Calculate trajectory and assess interception need.
	-- Transition to:
		- (Idle) state if no interception needed.
		- (Interception) state if interception needed.
5- Interception:
	- Command the missile launch system.
	-- Transition to:
		- (Alert) state if interception fails.
		- (Idle) state if interception succeeds.
6- Alert:
	- Activate the red alert system.
	-- Transition to (Idle) state once the threat is neutralized.
